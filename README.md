### **🚀 IBM Applied Data Science Capstone Project**  

This repository contains the **IBM Applied Data Science Capstone Project**, which applies **data science methodologies** to analyze **SpaceX launch data** and predict the success of **Falcon 9 first-stage landings**.  

---  

## **📖 Project Overview**  

### **🔹 Context**  
SpaceX has revolutionized space travel with reusable rockets, significantly reducing launch costs compared to competitors. The **Falcon 9 rocket launch** costs **$62 million**, while traditional providers charge over **$165 million**. Much of this cost reduction comes from **reusing the first stage of the rocket**.  

The objective of this project is to analyze **historical SpaceX launch data** to answer the following questions:  
- **What factors affect the success of the first-stage landing?**  
- **Has the success rate of landings improved over time?**  
- **Which machine learning algorithm best predicts a successful landing?**  

By predicting whether the **first stage of a Falcon 9 rocket will successfully land**, we can estimate launch costs and help **competing companies bid against SpaceX** more accurately.
